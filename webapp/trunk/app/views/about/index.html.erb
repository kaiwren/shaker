<h1>About Shaker</h1>

<p class="web-two-oh-crazy">We wrote Shaker to increase transparency in ThoughtWorks by providing an open avenue for salary publication. Most ThoughtWorkers have, at one
  time or another, discussed the possibility of publishing salaries. However, because ThoughtWorks is such a diverse company it would be unfair and unreasonable to
  forcibly publish everyone's salary. Shaker is the social solution to this problem.</p>

<p class="web-two-oh-crazy">And please remember that Shaker is all in good fun. It's also completely voluntary; if you'd prefer not to participate, simply don't log in.</p>
